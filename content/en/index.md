Welcome to the Engineering Effectiveness Handbook! We are the team of engineering leaders behind [Okay](https://www.okayhq.com) and the authors of the first version of this handbook.

After talking to hundreds of engineering leaders, we know 2 things:
* the vast majority of engineering teams want to become more effective
* but not everyone knows where to start

This handbook intends to fill that gap. Our goal is to build the **first practical and actionable guide to engineering effectiveness**.

We decided to give this work to the community under CC-BY-SA and we welcome contributions, which you can provide in 2 main ways:
* adding amazing pointers to our [curated list of engineering effectiveness resources](resources)
* contributing a chapter or an entire section to the handbook

We hope you'll enjoy reading this handbook!
