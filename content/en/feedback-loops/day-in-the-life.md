## Poor effectiveness culture:
- Paged after hours/Interrupted sleep
- Wake up and go to stand up
- Bug triage mostly to other teams
- Skip lunch
- 2 1 Hour Interviews
- Frontend council meeting
- Slack engineers for code reviews from last week
- 5PM take a look at the backlog

## High effectiveness culture:
- Standup
- Take meaty backlog item and spend 3 hour working on it, Submit for code review
- Grab lunch
- Respond to morning code review requests
- Address code review comments, Merge and deploy change
- Start on design doc for new feature (2 hours) 


## What's at stake
As you can extrapolate from the day in the life of a poor effectiveness culture, the consequences of not optimizing feedback loops:

- Attrition: Eventually engineers will leave the company out of frustration.  They want to deliver high quality code and have an impact on customers but too many things are getting in their way.
- Poor developer experience - Morale will suffer as engineers get more and more frustrated with not being able to do their job
- Lower quality code - Engineers will run and write tests less often because they are hard to create or take too long to run
- Slower delivery - The accumulation of delays on the things developers have to do regularly stack up and result in slower progress
- Difficulties hiring top talent - Over time the top engineers will move on, your Eng brand will suffer, and it will get harder to convince top talent to join as they will perceive pain points.
