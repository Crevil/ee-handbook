Feedback loops are the **set of tasks that an engineer does repeatedly** to deliver software.  Examples of feedback loops include everything from how long an IDE takes to do mini-tasks like code autocomplete to larger tasks like how long it takes an engineer to launch a new service in production.

How well these loops perform **creates the foundation for how effective your organization can be**.  A feedback loop taking longer or being more painful to perform has the impact of both reducing the frequency of times itâ€™s used as well as slowing down delivery of software.  

For example if running unit tests locally on a developer laptop takes 30 minutes instead of 5 seconds, developers are less likely to write new tests and to run tests locally.  In this case, the impact of the poorly performing feedback loop is **slower coding and lower quality code** in the long term.

## Factors that matter for Feedback Loops:
- **Frequency**: Some activities are performed by developers 100s of times a day (IDE autocomplete), and others are typically performed less than once a year (onboard to a new team).
- **Latency**: How long feedback loops take can vary widely from milliseconds/seconds while others can be measured on the order of weeks
- **Usability**: How easy it is to perform the activity
- **Purpose**: Some loops exist for the purpose of improving code quality (code reviews) while others exist to enable you to write and ship code (deploying a new version of a service)

Calculating the cost of a feedback loop is not as simple as multiplying the frequency times the latency.  The cost of latency typically follows step function increases:

- **Less than 5 seconds** - Stay on the same screen and wait
- **5 seconds - 1 minute** - Do a quick Slack check and come back (return in 5 minutes)
- **1 minute - 10 minutes** - Go grab coffee (return in 15 minutes)
- **10 minutes - 1 hour** - Come back to it sometime later (return in ~ 4 hours)
- **\> 1 hour** - Check in next day

Seemingly small changes in latency can lead to cascading downstream effects to the iteration velocity for an engineer, and for the team as a whole.  On the flip side, a huge investment in a loop may not yield a positive return on investment until it materially breaks through one of those thresholds.
