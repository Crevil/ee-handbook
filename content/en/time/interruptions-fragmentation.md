## Interruptions
- **Pages**:  Incidents can happen at any time and require team members to step in and even when they don’t can distract them from the task they were doing. 
- **Slack/Email/Tap on the shoulder/Etc**:  Communication during the day can lead to interruptions especially if the expectation is to be immediately responsive to a message.
- **Slow tooling**: If your build/test/etc tooling you need to accomplish a task are too slow, you generally will use the time to do something else which could take you out of the focused flow state and cost an expensive and potentially longer than intended context switch.

## Fragmentation
- **High Meeting Load / Meeting culture**:  This is typically one of the biggest causes of low maker time for engineers.  There are many reasons why a high meeting culture develops.  Low accountability environments, unclear decision making processes, lack of trust/high politics, poor meeting hygiene and many other factors can contribute to higher background meeting load.
- **Interview load**:  High interview load can be caused by unbalanced interviews where not enough people are trained or people are not fairly assigned to interviews.  This can also be a deliberate cost of a fast growing team.
- **Lack of deliberate scheduling**:  As described in the example above the same total meeting time can be organized in different ways that significantly impacts the total available Maker Time for a person.


> Carefully minimizing these two types of context switching categories for your team is an extremely high leverage investment.  If you make a meaningful dent your team will notice, and you will have more and more impact.  If you don’t eventually they will give feedback and eventually either burn out and leave.
